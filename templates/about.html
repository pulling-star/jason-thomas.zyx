  <p>I am a backend developer who uses Python to solve interesting problems.<p>
  <p>The work I do is a mix of data analysis and making/maintaining a RESTful API for the
  front end of our application to use. The data analysis involves directed graphs, as we study
  the relationship between data.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I make games, ride a unicycle, play a flute and eat ham sandwiches.</p>
  <p>Before becoming a programmer, I was a data journalist at SBS News where I wrote articles, made web scrapers and produced interactive data visualisations. See <a href="/my_work">my work</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jase_thomas" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/JasonThomasData" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
