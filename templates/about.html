  <p>I am a student of maths at RMIT. I was previously a backend developer. I love solving interesting problems.<p>
  <p>My current professional interests are mathematical modelling, making simulations (like Markov Chains) and programming generally.</p>
  <p>Before becoming a programmer I was a data journalist at SBS News where I wrote articles, made web scrapers and produced interactive data visualisations. See <a href="/articles">articles</a> and <a href="/my_work">tools</a> for more details.</p>
  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/jase_thomas" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/JasonThomasData" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
