Personal blog site - will be posting about Python, things I learn with code, unicycles, etc.

This site is hosted from a VPS - I'd probably prefer to use Heroku otherwise, but this allowed me to learn how Linux, Apache2 and virtual hosts interact.

This site uses Flask, which for something simple like a blog, you could argue is a better option than Rails or Django. If I wanted to manage client details or do fancy stuff, Rails might be a better option.

This blog has also allowed me to learn more about Flask, which I think would really be a great option if you wanted to make simple restful APIs - the kind of thing that accepts a post or a get request via a query string or Ajax call and returns a result.

This blog was made using the standard Flask blog tutorial, which I altered and changed for my own purposes. You can read more about [what I've done to change this blog](http://www.jason-thomas.xyz/post?postNum=0), on the first ever blog post for that page.
